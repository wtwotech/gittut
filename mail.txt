I would implore you to please consider my late submission as it should have been submitted since yesterday(Friday) but for some unkown reason my mail service provider screened out the email as spam and stored it in my Junk mail folder which I never considered to check until a co-applicant called and informed me that he had received a mail from your organization. 

I look forward to your kind consideration.
